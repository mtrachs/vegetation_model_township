# vegetation_model_township

.cpp file: modified stepps-vegetation model (tree counts are at township level and not at grid level), 
           code does compile but doesn't run  currently not running
Problems with .cpp file: gradient for multinomial still assumes tree count data is at grid-level not at township level)


.dump and .Rdata files are input files based on township count data
